WordPress Heatmap Plugin

## Overview
The heat-trackr plugin allows the user to display the following:

1. heatmaps (a heatmap is a graphical representation of data using colors to indicate the level of activity).
2. clickmaps (a clickmap shows where users have clicked on a page and the count).
3. scattermaps (a scattermap shows where individual clicks have been made by users on a page).
4. scrollmaps (a scrollmap shows how far down a page the visitors have made it).

Additionally the user can also configure and measure A/B style split testing.
